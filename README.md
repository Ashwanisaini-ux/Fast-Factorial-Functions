Fast Factorial Functions
========================

Here you can find implementations of the most efficient algorithms to compute

* the [factorial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) function,
* the [double factorial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_factorial#Double_factorial) function,
* the [binomial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial) function.

Additionally you can find

* a small database of factorial algorithm is given which let you
  quickly find the most appropriate version for your needs.
  
* An efficient sieve of Eratosthenes implemented in an object-oriented way.   


Implementation languages
------------------------

* Project '''MpirBasedFunctions''' : C++
* Project '''SilverFactorial64''' : C#
* Project '''JavaFactorial''' : Java

The C# and the Java version come with a small benchmark program.
See some [pictures](http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/download.html).


Dependencies
------------

To build you need for

* the C++ version the [MPIR](http://www.mpir.org) library and the
[boost](http://www.boost.org) library.

* The C# version can be configured to use System.Numerics.BigInteger or to
use the [MPIR](http://www.mpir.org) library (an interop is provided).

* The Java version needs Mikko Tommila's [Apfloat](http://www.apfloat.org/apfloat_java) 
library. If you want to use the benchmark program additionally Karsten 
Lentzsch's [JGoodies](http://www.jgoodies.com/downloads/libraries.html) is needed.


To do
-----

* Port the algorithms to [Go](http://golang.org/).
